# GeneticSoldiers
## An experiment in basic genetic algorithims.
This project will run two AI units against each other in a basic game. The game consists of 3 moves: Move towards enemy, Shoot, and Melee. 
The first AI is created with a basic if/else decision making process. If can attack: then attack; else move closer. 
Second, an generation of AI based on a genome is created with random mutations introduced. All of these bred AIs are run against the basic one
and the 2 with the highest score are bred to create the next generation's base genome. 
As the program progresses, the bred AI will approach a 100% victory rate against the basic AI.
